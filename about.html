                            </font><font align="center">I’m Robert McDougal and I’m taking the time to write about myself. I’m a coding apprentice under the tutelage of continuing education people of UCI. Iv’e always loved websites, they look so cool and the way people can spend hours and hours on a single site being entertained is enthralling in of itself. I remember when I made Youtube videos where I talked about movies and games. I’d use footage when giving commentary and all the content creators had sites as a backup for their videos due to Youtube’s copyright rules. The way you can have your own corner of the internet free of changing layouts. I can have whatever content I produce be played solely on my site against the stylized backdrop I designed. Under the Portfolio section on this very page, I have the Scratch game I made for the pre-work, as well as a link to my Youtube channel. Beyond that, I already can easily make sites for two ideas I plan on getting around to. I have a lip balm subscription company I’m working on and someday, I’d like to make videos again and have a weekly podcast and I already made some HTML for the front page and a logo. None of these will be earth-shattering services. I think Python and any kind of coding language that can be used for automation or AI will be where the innovation and big bucks are at, should I decided to go down that road. The dot com boom and subsequent crash is as cemented in history as Nagasaki, the entrepreneurial radiation long subsidized. So I doubt anyone in this class will make the next Amazon or Facebook. For the past two decades, millions of people have been making site after site, exhausting out every conceivable idea six ways from Sunday. There was an app boom for a few years following the widespread use of smartphones. There’s absolutely still a market there and people are always looking for new apps. The networking possibilities and communication stuff like Slack are worth getting familiar with as many startups use it. My other hobbies are powerlifting, playing the piano, playing pool and writing screenplays. I have lots of streaming apps so I try to squeeze watching movies whenever my schedule is on a coffee break or distracted by a plane, usually movies no one has heard of like The American Friend or Big Night. </font>
